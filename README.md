## Project Graduation : AZAP - As Zemovie As Possible

Two applications : Front-End (react-azap) and Back-End (api-azap). These applications are still under development.

At a time when we consume more and more films thanks to
multiple streaming services made available to us in the form of
subscription and also thanks to the films you can buy or own physically or dematerialized, how can we
manage all of this effectively?

The idea is to centralize in a single application libraries created by the user where he can add the films he has seen, that he owns, that he would like to see, that he would like to buy.
